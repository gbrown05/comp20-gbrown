Lab 6: Friends of Ming Chow

jobs.html contains javascript that uses JSON to parse the given string. It
presents the position, comapny, and location of various jobs from the given
string. Clearly, the formatting is ugly, but I believe that I met all of the
requirements of the lab. I plan to continue making it look prettier on my own
for my own enrichment.

I spent approximately 4-5 hours on this. Most time was spent figuring out how to
present the information that I got when I parsed the string.

Siddhartha Prasad gave me an idea about how to present information on the
webpage.
