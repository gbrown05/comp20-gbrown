COMP 20 Lab #4: OMFGDOGS
George Brown, 9 February 2014

The GIF and mp3 files used for this assignment were provided by Ming Chow, and 
the original OMFGDOGS site is given credit via a link in the bottom right 
corner.

I used Stack Overflow to learn about setting screen dimensions with CSS, and I
learned about the HTML5 audio tag from the Mozilla Developer Network.

The assignment took me about 2 hours.

Description:

As long as the browser is at least 992 pixels wide, the OMFGDOGS GIF covers the
body of the browser and the OMFGDOGS mp3 file plays in a loop as soon as the
page is loaded. If the browser is narrower that 992 pixels, the mp3 still plays,
but no GIF is displayed -- just the text "No OMFGDOGS for you!"
