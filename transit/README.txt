George Brown, Comp 20, Assignment 3: MBTA Map Rodeo
14 March 2014

To my knowledge, all required parts of the assignment have been correctly 
implemented and there are no bugs. However, the times listed for each T stop 
are not listed in order of the next departure.

- Right now, nearest T stop is not listed.


I collaborated briefly with Siddhartha Prasad regarding the XMLHttpRequest. I
also spoke about the Haversine formula with Skyler Tom, and helped Nadav
Gavrielov a little bit with parsing JSON.

I spent about 12-14 hours on this assignment. But I really have no idea, because
there were a lot of times that I just opened my computer and worked for a few
minutes on the assignment.
