George Brown, Comp 20, Assignment 3: MBTA Map Rodeo
14 March 2014

To my knowledge, all required parts of the assignment have been correctly 
implemented and there are no bugs. However, the times listed for each T stop 
are not listed in order of the next departure. The info window containing the
user's current location automatically pops up; it also reappears ifthe user
clicks it after closing it.

I collaborated briefly with Siddhartha Prasad early on regarding the 
XMLHttpRequest. I also spoke about the Haversine formula with Skyler Tom, and
helped Nadav Gavrielov a little bit with parsing the JSON.

I used Ming's examples extensively, and I have tried to document this throughout
my code. I also used StackOverflow to reference the Haversine formula. The
Google Maps API tutorial was very handy as well.

I spent about 12-14 hours on this assignment. But I really have no idea, because
there were a lot of times that I just opened my computer and worked for a few
minutes on the assignment.
