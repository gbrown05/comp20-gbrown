George Brown, Comp 20, Assignment #2: The beginning of Duckhunt

This code draws a screen of the Duckhunt game with the required
objects, including the sky, dirt, bushes, tree, dog, and 5 birds. It uses the 
sprite sheet (in the assets directory) and the Image class extensively.

Currently, the dirt at the bottom of the screen is black in Firefox. It works as
expected in Chrome and Safari, and I'm still trying to figure out what the cause
of this is.

I collaborated with Siddhartha Prasad and Victor Chao on this assignment. Sid
helped me get to the right place on the MDN website to find out how the Image
class works in Javascript.

I spent about 9-10 hours on this assignment.
