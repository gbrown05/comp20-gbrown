George Brown, Comp 20, Assignment #2: The beginning of Duckhunt

This code draws a screen of the Duckhunt game with the required
objects, including the sky, dirt, bushes, tree, dog, and 5 birds. It uses the 
sprite sheet (in the assets directory) and the Image class extensively.

There are no known bugs.

I collaborated with Siddhartha Prasad and Victor Chao on this assignment. Sid
helped me get to the right place on the MDN website to find out how the Image
class works in Javascript. I also consulted TA Nate Tarrh about why my dirt was
black in Firefox. (I ended up figuring out that I forgot the # in front of my
hex values.)

I spent about 9-10 hours on this assignment.
