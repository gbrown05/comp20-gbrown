### Comp 20 Repo for George Brown, Spring '14

#### Purpose

This repository contains my work from COMP 20: Web Programming in Spring 2014 at Tufts University, taught by [Ming Chow](http://mchow01.github.io).

#### Favorite Assignment

My favorite assignment was the 2048 Gamecenter assignment. I had been looking forward to building web applications and learning about databases, and this assignment was a fun, engaging introduction.

#### Which Assignment are you most proud of?

I'm most proud of my MBTA Map. I spent a lot of time and added a few details, and this was my first experience working with Google APIs. This assignment helped me learn how to RTFM.

#### Personal Growth

I think I have grown a lot in a few different ways from taking this class. I have learned how to find information I need to get the job done, whether that means Google, StackOverflow, or asking friends. I've also come a long way in understanding the core principles of how the Internet works. I've learned a little bit about security, but I'd like to learn more -- and I know that the skills I learned in this class will allow me to become more knowledgeable on my own.
