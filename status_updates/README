Lab 7 (Part 1)

In thi lab, I modified Lab 5 so messages are stored in local storage.

The functionality is the same (on Chrome; Firefox is a little buggy). Now, when
you leave the page and return, messages from before appear: this is because they
are being stored using localStorage.

I also added a simple hack to clear the text field on change.

My herokuapp nodejs URL: http://peaceful-headland-1158.herokuapp.com

I spent about 3 hours on this lab. I didn't discuss it much, but I did talk
briefly with Siddhartha Prasad about lcoal storage and Skyler Tom about 
herokuapp.

Lab 5 -- DOM
George Brown, 18 February 2014

The page profile.html conforms to the given specifications. It also prints
leading zeroes for the minutes; for example, 1:02 is printed (not 1:2).

I spent approximately 4 hours on this lab, much of it reading documentation from
MDN and Stackoverflow. Skyler Tom and Siddhartha Prasad also discussed the lab
with me. I helped Tom Strassner and Victor Chao.
