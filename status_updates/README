Lab 5 -- DOM
George Brown, 18 February 2014

The page profile.html conforms to the given specifications. It also prints
leading zeroes for the minutes; for example, 1:02 is printed (not 1:2).

I spent approximately 4 hours on this lab, much of it reading documentation from
MDN and Stackoverflow. Skyler Tom and Siddhartha Prasad also discussed the lab
with me. I helped Tom Strassner and Victor Chao.
